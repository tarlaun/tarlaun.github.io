# Short tagline shown in previews/search
excerpt: "Computer Science PhD student at UCR — scalable geospatial visualization & analytics"
---
I am **Tarlan Bahadori**, a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of California, Riverside, advised by [Prof. Ahmed Eldawy](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eldawy/). My research lies at the intersection of data systems and geospatial analytics. I design and evaluate **scalable systems for interactive exploration of large geospatial datasets**, with an emphasis on efficient data processing, indexing, and visualization. A current thrust of my work integrates **generative AI** and **large language models** to enable semantically guided querying and style generation for spatial data, advancing reproducible, user-driven analysis at scale.


My interests are divided between a variety of fields, I enjoy studying and creating algorithms. I am also passionate about music, history, and language skills.

### Short Bio (LinkedIn-style)
- **PhD Researcher, UCR** — advised by **Prof. Ahmed Eldawy**; focus on **scalable geospatial visualization**, **vector tiles**, and **LLM-assisted cartography**.  
- **Projects**:  
  - **LASEK** — *LLM-Assisted Style Exploration Kit* for geospatial data (Spark/Scala + Flask + React/OpenLayers, Mapbox Vector Tiles).  
  - **SGV** — *Spatial Graph Visualization* using anchoring forces and layout acceleration for large networks.
- **Publications & demos**: preparing a **VLDB 2025 demo** (LASEK) and a **SIGSPATIAL 2025 short/SRC piece** on visualization-aware compression.
- **Interests**: interactive mapping, styling/legends, visualization-aware compression, force-directed layouts at scale, reproducible geospatial workflows.
- **Tech**: Scala/Spark, Python, React/OpenLayers, Tippecanoe/MBTiles, GeoPandas; data-to-tiles pipelines and UI for real-time styling.
- **Languages**: Persian (native), English, Spanish, French.
- **Opportunities**: open to **research/engineering internships** in **Summer 2025** (R&D, geospatial systems, data visualization).
