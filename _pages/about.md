excerpt: "Computer Science PhD student at UCR â€” scalable geospatial visualization & analytics"
---
I am **Tarlan Bahadori**, a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of California, Riverside, advised by [Prof. Ahmed Eldawy](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eldawy/). My research lies at the intersection of data systems and geospatial analytics. I design and evaluate **scalable systems for interactive exploration of large geospatial datasets**, with an emphasis on efficient data processing, indexing, and visualization. A current focus of my work integrates **generative AI** and **large language models** to enable semantically guided querying and style generation for spatial data, advancing reproducible, user-driven analysis at scale.


My interests are divided between a variety of fields, I enjoy studying and creating algorithms. I am also passionate about music, history, and language skills.


- **Languages**: English, Persian French, Spanish, Portuguese
- 
- **Opportunities**: open to **research/engineering internships** in **Summer 2025** (R&D, geospatial systems, data visualization).
